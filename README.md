# GT-Coding Bootcamp -- 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## 1. Overview:

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. This is a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

This dashboard uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.
